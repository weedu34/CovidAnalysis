## Data Sources
I have used the following data set used for my data exploration project in SQL: 
Edouard Mathieu, Hannah Ritchie, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao, Cameron Appel, Charlie Giattino, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Saloni Dattani, Diana Beltekian, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser (2020) - "Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)". Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus' [Online Resource]


This project is entirely developed in SQL studio management, The link to SQL File is: [SQL_File](https://github.com/weedu34/CovidAnalysis/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql)

Data is downloaded through above mentioned link and then segmented and modified into two separate Excel files named: **CovidDeaths.xlsx** which contains the country-wise data of all deaths that occurred and **CovidVaccinations.xlsx** contains vaccination data according to country and date.

Please ensure the data is up-to-date and accurate, as the quality of the visualizations depends on the data integrity.
