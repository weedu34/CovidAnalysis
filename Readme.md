Edouard Mathieu, Hannah Ritchie, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao, Cameron Appel, Charlie Giattino, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Saloni Dattani, Diana Beltekian, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser (2020) - "Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)".

This project is entirely developed in SQL studio management, The link to SQL File is: [SQL_File](https://github.com/weedu34/CovidAnalysis/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql)

Data is downloaded through above mentioned link and then segmented into two separate Excel files named: **CovidDeaths.xlsx** which contains the country-wise data of all deaths that occurred and **CovidVaccinations.xlsx** contains vaccination data according to country and date.
